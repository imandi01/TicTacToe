This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game for two players. The game uses a linked list to represent the 3x3 game board. Players take turns placing 'X' or 'O' on the board, and the game checks for winners or a draw.

You need to download the following files from the repository:
Node.java

The game will ask each player to enter a number between 1 and 9 to place their mark ('X' or 'O') on the board.

The numbers represent positions on the board like this:
1 | 2 | 3  
4 | 5 | 6  
7 | 8 | 9

Players take turns entering numbers to place their marks.

The game ends when one player wins by getting 3 marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) or when all spaces are filled (a draw).

Example 
Player X, enter your move (1-9): 5
 1 | 2 | 3 
 4 | X | 6 
 7 | 8 | 9 

Player O, enter your move (1-9): 1
 O | 2 | 3 
 4 | X | 6 
 7 | 8 | 9
